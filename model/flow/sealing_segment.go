// SealingSegment is the chain segment such that the last block (greatest height)
// is this snapshot's reference block and the first (least height) is the most
// recently sealed block as of this snapshot (ie. the block referenced by LatestSeal).
//
// In other words, the most recently incorporated seal as of the highest block
// references the lowest block. The highest block does not need to contain this seal.
//
// Example 1 - E seals A:
//
//	A <- B <- C <- D <- E(SA)
//
// The above sealing segment's last block (E) has a seal for block A, which is
// the first block of the sealing segment.
//
// Example 2 - E contains no seals, but latest seal prior to E seals A:
//
//	A <- B <- C <- D(SA) <- E
//
// Example 3 - E contains multiple seals
//
//	B <- C <- D <- E(SA, SB)
//
// MINIMALITY REQUIREMENT:
// Note that block B is the highest sealed block as of E. Therefore, the
// sealing segment's lowest block must be B. Essentially, this is a minimality
// requirement for the history: it shouldn't be longer than necessary. So
// extending the chain segment above to A <- B <- C <- D <- E(SA, SB) would
// _not_ yield a valid SealingSegment.
//
// ROOT SEALING SEGMENTS:
// Root sealing segments are sealing segments which contain the root block:
// * the root block is a self-sealing block with an empty payload
// * the root block must be the first block (least height) in the segment
// * no blocks in the segment may contain any seals (by the minimality requirement)
// * it is possible (but not necessary) for root sealing segments to contain only the root block
//
// Example 1 - one self-sealing root block
//
//	ROOT
//
// The above sealing segment is the form of sealing segments within root snapshots,
// for example those snapshots used to bootstrap a new network, or spork.
//
// Example 2 - one self-sealing root block followed by any number of seal-less blocks
//
//	ROOT <- A <- B
//
// All non-root sealing segments contain more than one block.
// Sealing segments are in ascending height order.
//
// In addition to storing the blocks within the sealing segment, as defined above,
// the SealingSegment structure also stores any resources which are referenced
// by blocks in the segment, but not included in the payloads of blocks within
// the segment. In particular:
// * results referenced by receipts within segment payloads
// * results referenced by seals within segment payloads
// * seals which represent the latest state commitment as of a segment block

	// These extra blocks are included in order to ensure that a newly bootstrapped node
	// knows about all entities which might be referenced by blocks which extend from
